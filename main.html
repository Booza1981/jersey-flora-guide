            <p>Hello! Are you ready for an adventure? Jersey is full of amazing plants! Tall trees reach for the sky, and colourful wildflowers hide like jewels in the grass and hedges. Let's go exploring together and see what we can find!</p>
            
            <p>This guide is like a treasure map to help us become super Plant Detectives. We can look closely at the shapes of the leaves, feel the bumpy bark on the trees, see all the pretty colours of the flowers, and maybe even find some seeds or berries!</p>
            
            <p>There's a special checklist at the end so we can tick off all the wonderful trees and flowers we spot on our adventure. Grab your grown-up, put on your explorer hat, and let's go find some plants!</p>

            <h2>(Section 2) Wonderful Trees of Jersey</h2>
            
            <p>Trees are amazing big plants. They have strong, woody trunks and lots of branches that reach up high, like arms waving hello. Their leaves help them make food from sunshine! Let's meet some of the friendly trees that live here in Jersey. Many organisations, like Jersey Trees for Life, work hard to plant and look after trees because they are so important for our island.<sup>1</sup></p>

                </div>
                <p>I am a graceful tree, often looking tall and slim. I'm known as a 'pioneer' because I can grow in lots of different places, even where the soil isn't very rich.</p>

                <p>My bark is my most special feature — it's bright white or silvery! Sometimes it peels off like thin paper. Younger trees might have darker bark first.</p>

                <p>Like the Oak, I have dangly flowers called catkins. They release tiny seeds that the wind carries far away.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I often grow in hedges and can be quite bushy and dense. Watch out — I have sharp thorns! I can grow into a small tree too, reaching up to 15 metres.</p>

                <p>My leaves are small, usually with 3 to 7 pointy bits called lobes. They are often one of the first green leaves you'll see in spring.</p>

                <p>I make lots of pretty white flowers in May (that's why some people call me "May blossom"). They smell sweet and attract bees and other insects.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Foxglove - All parts are poisonous</li>

                <p>Please help children appreciate nature without picking wildflowers. Many wildflowers are protected and important for local wildlife. Taking photos is a great alternative to collecting!</p>

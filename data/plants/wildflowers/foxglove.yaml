fun_facts:
  - My name might come from 'folk's glove' (fairy glove) because people thought fairies gave the flowers to foxes to wear as gloves so they could sneak into chicken coops without making noise!
  - Bumblebees love to crawl inside my flowers to get nectar.
  - I'm a biennial plant, which means I grow leaves in my first year and flower in my second year.
  - Medicine can be made from my leaves (but only by trained professionals in laboratories).

warnings:
  - All parts of me are poisonous if eaten, so please just enjoy looking at me!
  - Don't touch me as I can be harmful - just admire my beautiful flowers from a safe distance.
  - Never eat any part of the plant, even if you think it looks interesting.

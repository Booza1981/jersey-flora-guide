fun_facts:
  - If you hold me under your chin and see a yellow reflection, it means you like butter! (This is actually just because my petals are very shiny)
  - My shiny petals are caused by a special layer of cells that reflects yellow light.
  - Cows and horses don't eat me because I taste bitter and can be toxic.
  - My Latin name 'Ranunculus' means 'little frog' because I often grow in damp places where frogs live.

warnings:
  - I contain a toxic compound that can cause blistering if eaten or handled roughly.
  - Keep me away from livestock as I can be harmful if eaten.
  - Wash your hands after handling me.

fun_facts:
  - My name 'Mountain Ash' comes from the fact that my leaves look a bit like ash tree leaves, even though we're not related!
  - My other name 'Rowan' comes from an old Nordic word meaning 'getting red' - because of my berries!
  - In old folklore, I was thought to protect against evil spirits.
  - Birds love my berries so much that they often eat them all before winter!

warnings:
  - Raw berries shouldn't be eaten by humans.
  - Please leave the berries for the birds who need them for food.

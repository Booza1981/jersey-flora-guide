_**User**_

Can you extract the html for the 2 orchids from this file

_**Assistant**_

I notice that you're asking about extracting HTML for orchids, but I don't see any file attached or referenced in your request. Could you please:

1. Share the file you'd like me to extract the orchid information from, or
2. Provide the URL where this information is located

Once you provide either the file or URL, I'll be happy to help extract the HTML for the orchids.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you extract and clean up the HTML for both orchids. Let me create two separate files for each orchid with clean, modern HTML.
